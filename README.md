This is my copy of the "SwiftUI App Dev" tutorial series by Apple. I mostly dabbled with Swift and iOS dev in the past, but decided it's time to start improving these skills too.

## What have I learned in this tutorial?
* Using SwiftUI for the full app life cycle.
* Lots of accessibility features in SwiftUI.
* The elementary definition of a "scrum".

## Perquisites
* iOS 14.2 / Xcode 12.3 / Swift 5.3
* Some features, like testing VoiceOver, require a physical device instead of the simulator.
